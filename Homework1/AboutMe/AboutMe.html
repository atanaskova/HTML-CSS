                Welcome to my first web. I'm still learining how to write webs, but I think I'm getting good at it.

                My name is Jessica Richie and I'm 21 years old. I attend a school in the USA. </br>
                I like to read and sometimes (mainly in summer) I play sports. </br>
                My main hobby is (and I hope it will be my occupation soon too) <b>programming!</b>
            </p>

                In the first year I started with PASCAL. I was looking for some modern languages on the Internet and I found
                ICT.social, where I've started learning <b>C#</b> and <b>Java</b>. </br>
                I am able to develop simple applications so far.

                The website is based on the HTML tutorials from <a href="https://www.ict.social/">ict.social</a>
